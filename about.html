          The story of Raskot Metal Furniture Udhyog begins with Anand Bikram
          Shahi, a visionary entrepreneur with a deep commitment to his

          of the district and the need for sustainable development. He believed
          that economic empowerment could be a catalyst for change and

        <p class="kalikot_des">
          Anand Bikram Shahi's commitment to the development of Kalikot goes
          beyond just running a furniture business. He understands the
          importance of social responsibility, and as an ISS member, he actively
          engages in various community development activities. The success of
          Raskot Metal Furniture Udhyog has been instrumental in creating
          employment opportunities for the local population, reducing the
          migration of skilled workers to urban areas, and boosting the
          district's economy. The business directly sources its raw materials,
          such as metal, wood, and other necessary supplies, from local vendors.
          This not only supports the local economy but also ensures that the
          production process is environmentally sustainable. The emphasis on
          sustainability and the use of eco-friendly materials has contributed
          to a positive image for the business in the region.

          Bikram Shahi firmly believes in gender equality and providing equal
          opportunities to women. The success of these women in a traditionally
          male-dominated field serves as an inspiration to other young girls in
          Kalikot, encouraging them to pursue their passions and careers without
          constraints.
